# 🏥 Organ Donation and Matching System

## 📘 Description
The Organ Donation and Matching System is a C language mini project that helps hospitals and donation centers store, manage, and match organ donors with recipients efficiently. It reduces manual work and improves the speed and accuracy of organ allocation.

## ⚙️ Features
- Stores donor and recipient details using structures  
- Matches based on *blood group, **organ type, and **location*  
- Handles up to *200 records* using file handling  
- Includes *organ priority, **urgency level, and **availability status*  
- Uses C concepts like *loops, arrays, pointers, strings, functions, unions, and **files*

## 🧠 Matching Logic
A match occurs when:
- Blood group matches  
- Organ type matches  
- (Optionally) City matches

  *Example:*

Donor: O+, Kidney, Hyderabad
Recipient: O+, Kidney, Hyderabad → Matched!

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add date/time of donation  
- Include medical test results for advanced matching  
- Improve user interface for hospitals

## 💻 How to Run
1. Compile the program using any C compiler (e.g., GCC or Turbo C).  
2. Run the executable file.  
3. Enter donor and recipient details as prompted.  
4. The system will automatically find matches and display results.
